## Who's Dinê?

One of the great names of the culture of Irará, **Antônio Cardoso** (popularly known as **Dinê**) was the creator of _Cambraínha_, the donkey made of fabric that cheers the popular festivities of the city. In 2009, Dinê received the **Master of Popular Culture** (_Mestre da Cultura Popular_) award from the Ministry of Culture of Brazil.

Unfortunately, Dinê passed away earlier this year. It will always be in the history of the city and in our hearts.
 
## Who's Cambraínha?

It's the name of the Dinê's Donkey. The name _Cambraínha_ comes from _cambric_, a type of fabric. Despite the name, the donkey is ornamented with various types of fabrics.

_In memory of Antônio Cardoso, the "Dinê da Burrinha" (Dinê of the Donkey)._
